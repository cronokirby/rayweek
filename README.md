# rayweek

This is a project following the ["Ray Tracing in a Weekend" book](http://www.realtimerendering.com/raytracing/Ray%20Tracing%20in%20a%20Weekend.pdf),
in Rust.

In an effort to keep in line with the simple nature of this introduction, this project limits itself to Rust's standard library.
Thankfully, this gives us plenty to work with :).
